            <p> Eczema, also known as atopic dermatitis, is a chronic skin condition characterized by inflammation, redness, itching, and the formation of dry, scaly patches on the skin. It can occur in people of all ages but is more common in children. Eczema is believed to be caused by a combination of genetic, environmental, and immune system factors.</p>
            <p> Common symptoms of eczema include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Itching: Often intense and persistent, leading to scratching, which can further irritate the skin.</li>
                <li>Redness: The affected areas of skin may become red or inflamed.</li>
                <li>Dryness: Eczema patches are typically dry and can develop into rough, scaly, or thickened skin.</li>
                <li>Rash: Rash-like patches may appear, often in areas where the skin folds, such as behind the knees, inside the elbows, on the hands, feet, face, or neck.</li>
                <li>Cracking: The skin may crack or develop small fissures, especially if it becomes excessively dry.</li>
                <li>Oozing or crusting: In severe cases, eczema lesions may ooze fluid or form crusts.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Eczema is a chronic condition with periods of flare-ups and remission. While there is no cure, various treatments, such as moisturizers, topical corticosteroids, antihistamines, and immune-modulating medications, can help manage symptoms and reduce inflammation. It's essential for individuals with eczema to identify and avoid triggers that exacerbate their symptoms, such as certain foods, environmental allergens, harsh soaps, or stress. Consulting with a dermatologist is recommended for proper diagnosis and treatment planning.</p>
